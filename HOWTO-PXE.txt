First, you should look at:

  http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install

  Specifically:  4.6. Preparing Files for TFTP Net Booting
 
N.B. if you have a machine that doesn't support PXE booting, you can
kick it off from a floppy.  See:

  http://www.rom-o-matic.net/

In short, you need to have set up:

  dhcp
  tftpd-hpa

Then, get the PXE tarball:

  cd /tmp
  wget http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/dists/sarge/main/installer-i386/current//images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz

untar it into /tftpboot (or wherever you've pointed your tftp server)

  tar -C /tftpboot -xvzf netboot.tar.gz

To generate the initrd images first decompress the initrd.gz of interest:

  zcat /tftpboot/debian-installer/i386/2.6/initrd.gz > /tmp/initrd-2.6

and/or

  zcat /tftpboot/debian-installer/i386/initrd.gz > /tmp/initrd-2.4

*********************************************************
*** Then follow the instructions in README-initrd.txt ***
*********************************************************

When you're done, unmount and re-compress the image (repeat for the other one if
you want support for both 2.4 & 2.6 kernels).

  umount /mnt
  gzip < /tmp/initrd-2.6 > /tftpboot/debian-installer/i386/2.6/auto-ird.gz
or
  gzip < /tmp/initrd-2.4 > /tftpboot/debian-installer/i386/auto-ird.gz

You're now ready to try a PXE boot.  Give it a go, and read
http://hands.com/d-i/ for hints on what to type at the boot prompt to
kick things off.
