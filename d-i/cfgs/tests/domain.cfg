# tests/domain.cfg preseed from http://hands.com/d-i/cfgs/

# This performs a domain to site mapping --- it does if via an md5sum to protect the innocent
# sitenames of the form hands-* are clients of hands.com.
# (I'll up the length of the sums used if we get conflicts)
#
# I'm happy to add third party domains to this list, just mail me the domain name that your DHCP
# server gives you, and the codename you want it under (unless you're putting sensitive data in
# the subsequent configuration files, I'd suggest using something like your domain name
#
# The only reason for the md5 nonsense is to allow me to publish real examples from my clients
# without giving (albeit trivial) details of their networks away
