<hr>

<p>This site contains a framework for automatically installing Debian
systems, based on recent (i.e. post-<em>sarge</em>, from svn) versions of
debian-installer.

<p>The software is available from the <a href="etch">published
area</a> or you can look at the <a
href="http://svn.hands.com/d-i/">bleeding edge version</a> in svn.

<hr>

<p>The features described depend on a new udeb called auto-install,
which is activated by setting the debconf variable
auto-install/enabled to true, which on the images available in the <a
href="etch/media/">media</a> directory is set autmatically by
selecting the <tt>auto</tt> image at the boot prompt. This delays the
kdb-chooser and localechooser udebs until after network-preseed,
allowing them to be presseded via the network.  Another feature of
auto-install is to expand preseed/url from a hostname to a full URL,
if only a hostname was provided.

<p>Since this is now based on debian-installer, with only minor
extensions, the build procedure is pretty much exactly the same as
building vanilla d-i from svn, <a
href="etch/docs/building.html">with a
couple of tweaks</a>.

<p>Once you have an appropriatly prepared boot medium, you are able to
type something like the following at the boot prompt:

<pre>
  boot: auto url=hands.com classes=xen3;loc/uk
</pre>

and get a Xen3 machine installed, with a UK keyboard and timezone,
without having to type another keystroke until the login prompt pops
up about 10 minutes later.

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>The slash-free parameters (like <tt>url</tt>) are actually just
aliases for normal debconf variables.  So far the following aliases
have been defined:

<pre>
auto            auto-install/enabled
classses        auto-install/classes
priority        debconf/priority
url             preseed/url
hostname        netcfg/get_hostname
domain          netcfg/get_domain
file            preseed/file
locale          debian-installer/locale
interface       netcfg/choose_interface
fb              debian-installer/framebuffer
suite		mirror/suite
</pre>

<p>by invoking the auto (or auto24) targets, you're just ensuring that
"auto=true DEBCONF_PRIORITY=critical" is added to the kernel command line.

<h3>url=<em>magic</em></h3>

<p>The auto-install.udeb package provides some magic for creating full
preseed urls from either just a hostname or a fully qualified domain
name.  If you provide a url that contains no slashes, auto-install's
postinst (which is run before network-preseed) assumes that you have
given it a hostname, and replaces it with a URL of the following form:
<pre>
	http://&lt;hostname&gt;/d-i/etch/./preseed.url
</pre>

<p>The <tt>&lt;hostname&gt;</tt> section of that is whatever you
provided as the URL, if it contained any dots, or, if it was without
dots (i.e. it's just the hostname) then the domain is added to it
(with that domain probably being found by netcfg, from a reverse
lookup of your DHCP IP address).  The <tt>etch</tt> bit of the path
matches the release the installer was part of.  The <tt>/./</tt> bit
is used by preseed_fetch as the root of the preseed area, so this is
where paths starting with <tt>/</tt> are anchored.

<p>Boot images with the modifications required are available in the <a
href="media">media</a> directory -- at present the netboot images are
the only ones that have been properly tested -- bug reports welcome.

<hr>

<p>Be aware that the scripts here depend on customised versions of
d-i.  If you're basing significant effort on the current setup, please
mirror all the files (probably with a subversion check-out) so you're
not dependant on me maintaining backwards compatibility</b>

<p>If you find this useful, and have ideas about how to improve it, or
would like to contribute your recipes, please get in touch with <a
