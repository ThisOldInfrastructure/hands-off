<h1>"Hands-off" Debian Installation</h1>

<p><font size="+1"><b>WARNING:</b> <em>don't just blithely try this on a
machine you care about -- it will cheerfully re-partition the hard disk,
and overwrite your data, WITHOUT asking for permission once you've
launched it, and that can include things like external USB-attached
hard drives if you're unlucky, so unplug them if you want to keep them,
unless you mean for it to use them -- you have been warned.</em></font>

<hr>

<p>This site contains a framework for automatically installing Debian
systems, based on Etch (and beyond) versions of debian-installer.

<p>The software is available from the <a href="etch">published
area</a> or you can look at the <a
href="http://svn.hands.com/d-i/">bleeding edge version</a> in svn.

<hr>

<p><em>This is now documented in the <a
href="http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.i386/apbs02.html#preseed-auto">debian-installer
manual for etch</a>, and the documentation there can be considered
more authoritative than what you find here (if you notice differences,
please mention them)</em>

<p>The features described depend on a new udeb called auto-install,
which is activated by setting the debconf variable
<tt>auto-install/enable</tt> to <tt>true</tt>, which on recent builds
of debian-installer media, is set automatically by selecting the
<tt>auto</tt> image at the boot prompt. This delays the kdb-chooser
and localechooser udebs until after network-preseed, allowing them to
be presseded via the network.  Another feature of auto-install is to
expand preseed/url from a hostname to a full URL, if only a hostname
was provided.

<p>For example, assuming you have a recent enough boot medium, you
will be able to type something like the following at the boot prompt:

<pre>
  boot: auto url=hands.com classes=xen3;loc/uk
</pre>

and get a Xen3 machine installed, with a UK keyboard and timezone,
without having to type another keystroke until the login prompt pops
up about 10 minutes later.

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>The slash-free parameters (like <tt>url</tt>) are actually just
aliases for normal debconf variables.  So far the following aliases
have been defined:

<pre>
auto            auto-install/enable
classes         auto-install/classes
priority        debconf/priority
url             preseed/url
hostname        netcfg/get_hostname
domain          netcfg/get_domain
file            preseed/file
locale          debian-installer/locale
interface       netcfg/choose_interface
fb              debian-installer/framebuffer
suite		mirror/suite
</pre>

<p>by invoking the <tt>auto</tt> target, you're just ensuring that <tt>auto=true
priority=critical</tt> is added to the kernel command line.

<h3>url=<em>magic</em></h3>

<p>The auto-install.udeb package provides some magic for creating full
preseed urls from either just a hostname or a fully qualified domain
name.  If you provide a url that contains no slashes, auto-install's
postinst (which is run before network-preseed) assumes that you have
given it a hostname, and replaces it with a URL of the following form:
<pre>
	http://&lt;hostname&gt;/d-i/etch/./preseed.url
</pre>

<p>The <tt>&lt;hostname&gt;</tt> section of that is whatever you
provided as the URL, if it contained any dots, or, if it was without
dots (i.e. it's just the hostname) then the domain is added to it
(with that domain probably being found by netcfg, from a reverse
lookup of your DHCP IP address).  The <tt>etch</tt> bit of the path
matches the release the installer was part of.  The <tt>/./</tt> bit
is used by preseed_fetch as the root of the preseed area, so this is
where paths starting with <tt>/</tt> are anchored.

<hr>

<p>Be aware that the scripts here depend on unreleased (at least until
Etch is released) versions of d-i.  If you're basing significant
effort on the current setup, please mirror all the files (probably
with a subversion check-out) so you're not dependant on me maintaining
backwards compatibility</b>

would like to contribute your recipes, please get in touch with <a
