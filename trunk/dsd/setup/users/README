This class allows users to be setup, with passwords, sudoer access and
ssh keys as needed

It works by looking for files named after the classes set for the machine
in <URL to your dsd area>/local/users/ starting with the fake class of
"default".  Whichever class is latest in the class list, and has a matching
file wins.

User file format:

The fields are colon separated:
  username
  crypt passwd
  sudoer
  gecos info for /etc/passwd
  ssh key name(s) -- comma separated

If you set root's crypted password to BLANK the install script will
remove root's password after the reboot, which can be handy while debugging

Comments can be specified by making them start with a # character

the ssh key names field is a comma separated list of names that are used to
construct filenames thus:

  <URL to your dsd area>/local/users/sshkeys.<ssh key name>

so the user gets the contents of all the listed key files placed in their
~/.ssh/authorized-keys.  Just put one or more id*.pub files in each of those
named key files.

I generally use this command to generate the first 2 fields:
   htpasswd -n -b username password

This class needs sudo to have already been installed by including it in
base_includes, so make sure that's happening if you want to add people
to the sudoers list, or it will break.
