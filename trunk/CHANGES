Make the initial dashslashdash.sh script assume that it should
get its files from a release directory, rather than the top level
so hands.com/d-i/dsd becomes svn.hands.com/d-i/tags/0.5/dsd, for example.

Compatibility with older versions of the config files is pretty badly broken

Since earlier versions, we now support executable preseed files, and
