<h1>"Hands-off" Debian Installation</h1>

<h2>All change again: now incorporated into debian-installer proper</h2>

<p>With luck that will be the major rewrite of this stuff, since
I'd like to start using it, rather than constantly rewriting it.  I'm
pretty hopeful on this front, since it's now being integrated into d-i
itself, and so does not have to flit around the periphery of a
constantly changing centre.

<p>Since this is now based on Etch debian-installer, with only minor
extensions, the build procedure is pretty much exactly the same as
building vanilla d-i.

<h3>dashslashdash is no more<h3>

<p>It's no longer needed, and we've come up with some rather more
meaningful variable names to provide the same functionality

<hr>

<p>This page describes some new features of debian-installer system
that allows automated installation.  If you obtain media that supports
this, you will find that you can (for example) type something like:

<pre>
  boot: auto url=intrnet cls=xen3;loc/uk
</pre>

and get a Xen3 machine installed, with a UK keyboard and timezone.

<p><b>WARNING:</b> <em>don't just blithely try this on a
machine you care about -- it will cheerfully re-partition the hard
disk, and overwrite your data, without asking for permission once
you've launched it.</em>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>The slash-free parameters (like <pre>url</pre>) are actually just
aliases for normal debconf variables.  So fare the following aliases
have been defined:

<pre>
auto            preseed/auto
cls             preseed/auto/classes
priority        debconf/priority
url             preseed/url
hostname        netcfg/get_hostname
domain          netcfg/get_domain
file            preseed/file
locale          debian-installer/locale
interface       netcfg/choose_interface
fb              debian-installer/framebuffer
suite		mirror/suite
</pre>

<p>by invoking the auto (or auto24) targets, you're just ensuring that
auto=true is added to the kernel command line.

<p>As mentioned above, if the url parameter is set to "intranet" some
magic is invoked to construct a URL for you.

<p><em>Boot images should appear over the next couple of days, as I test them.</em> 

<hr>

<p>Be aware that the scripts here depend on customised versions of d-i.
This breaks backwards compatibility.  Such changes may occur again.
If you're basing significant effort on the current setup, please
mirror all the files (probably with a subversion check-out) so you're
not dependant on me maintaining backwards compatibility (which I could
provide, but it would make the directory structure messy, so I
probably won't bother until version 1.0 and beyond -- this is BETA
software, after all -- you have been warned ;-)</b>

<p>If you find this useful, and have ideas about how to improve it, or would like to contribute your recipes, please get in touch with <a

<p>Have Fun!
