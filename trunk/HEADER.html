<title>"Hands-off" Debian Installation</title>
<h1>"Hands-off" Debian Installation</h1>

<p>This page describes some enhancements to the debian-installer
system that allows one to build installation media (<a href="create-CD.html">CD</a> <a href="setup-USB.html">USB</a> <a href="building-PXE.html">PXE</a>) that
behave normally, but also have the ability to do automated,
non-interactive installs.

<p>having booted from one of the modified images, one simply needs to
specify one or more of the -/* parameters described below to provoke
such an instalation.

<p><b>WARNING:</b> <em>don't just blithely try this on a
machine you care about -- it will cheerfully re-partition the hard
disk, and overwrite your data, without asking for permission once
you've launched it.</em>

<h2>How to use this:</h2>

In the simplest case, you can specify this at the boot prompt:
<pre>
  boot: linux -/-=;
</pre>
and it will do a minimal installation for you.

<h2>-/ parameters</h2>

<p>the <tt>-/</tt> parameters are used to activate an automatic
install.  If you have the dashslashdash.udeb on the initrd of your
boot media then setting either <tt>-/-</tt>, <tt>-/rel</tt>,
<tt>-/url</tt> or <tt>-/host</tt> on the kernel command line will
provoke an automatic install.

<h3>variables:</h3>
<dl>
<dt><tt><b>-/-</b></tt></dt>
<dd>this variable specifies the classes that should be installed on the system, separated by semi-colons (;).  If you want the default minimal install you can set it to ; (i.e. <b><tt>-/-=;</tt></b> ) which ends up invoking the auto-install without actually setting any classes</dd>
<dt><tt><b>-/url</b></tt></dt>
<dd>set an alternative source for the configuration files. (e.g. -/url=http://local.web.server/d-i)  Without this the boot will try to find a machine called debian-dsd-preseed.<em>DHCP-derived-domain</em>.  Failing that, it will get the files from svn.hands.com.</dd>
<dt><tt><b>-/rel</b></tt></dt>
<dd>This allows you to set the release protion of the URL where the dsd config will be found.  Here are some examples of what it does (assuming you don't have a local server, and that the current version of the dashslashdash package is 0.6):<pre>
   -/rel=     --> http://svn.hands.com/d-i/tags/0.6/
   -/rel=T    --> http://svn.hands.com/d-i/trunk/
   -/rel=foo  --> http://svn.hands.com/d-i/branch/foo/
</pre>
</dd>
<dt><tt><b>-/host</b></tt>
<dd>set the hostname and/or domain of the server.  This isn't quite working as yet.  I'm also going to allow the IP address, subnet etc. to be set via this.
</dl>

<h3>examples:</h3>

<pre>
  boot: linux26 -/-=kde341;loc/uk -/url=http://intra.hands.com/d-i/
</pre>
would set both the <tt>kde341</tt> and the <tt>loc/uk</tt> classes, and
would download the rest of the configuration settings from the
specified server. If any of the -/* settings are set, the
auto install is triggered.

<p>If it all works correctly, you'll end up with a system that has no
root password --- of course, for my sites, I install ssh keys, and for
some of my clients, I install predetermined passwords, but I don't
suppose you want me to be able to log into your systems, so setting no
password so you can set one yourself seemed like a fair default choice.

<p>If you care about security, or if you want to customise this
without reference to me, you should be able to copy the contents of
this directory to a local server (or use svn to grab a copy from
http://svn.hands.com/d-i/), and either tweak the preseed.cfg file used
to point at your server rather than mine, or set up a
debian-dsd-preseed CNAME, or specify the server to use as a <tt>-/url</tt>
command-line parameter.

<h2>dashslashdash.udeb 0.6 -- major changes</h2>

<p>This is no longer built in a way that allows one to take the released official boot images and apply a single package to the relevant initrd in order to enable the new features.  The documentation for the <a href="old-docs/HEADER.html">old approach</a> is preserved for historical interest.

<p>The new approach is to build initrd images using the same method as is used to build the released images themselves

<p>This uses the idea of classes (largely ripped off from FAI) with each class having a directory under the dsd directory.

<p>The initrd preseed file in the new setup is called dashslashdash.sh, it loads dsd/0-first.sh (from where you tell it, or from a host called debian-dsd-preseed.<yourdomain> if it exists, or from http://svn.hands.com/d-i/ as a last resort) which then bootstraps the rest of the preseed setup.

<p>The idea is that this will become part of the official Debian media
in which case if you don't specify anything weird on the command line,
all will appear normal, but if you add a -/- option it will be interpreted
as a class list, and will kick off an auto install.  For example:

<p>Be aware that the scripts here depend on dashslashdash-0.6 or
later.  This breaks backwards compatibility.  Such changes may occur
again.  If you're basing significant effort on the current setup,
please mirror all the files (probably with a subversion check-out) so
you're not dependant on me maintaining backwards compatibility (which
I could provide, but it would make the directory structure messy, so I
probably won't bother until version 1.0 and beyond -- this is BETA
software, after all -- you have been warned ;-)</b>
