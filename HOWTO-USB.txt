As recommended in

  http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.i386/ch04s02.html

grab a copy of the boot.img.gz:

  http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/sarge/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/boot.img.gz

put it on the stick (i.e. zcat boot.img.gz > /dev/sda)

Mount it (i.e. mount /dev/sda /mnt),

grab a copy of the netinst .iso from here:

  http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/3.1_r0a/i386/iso-cd/debian-31r0a-i386-netinst.iso

and copy it to /mnt (or wherever the stick is mounted).

Also copy these files to the stick: 

  http://hands.com/d-i/preseed.cfg
  http://hands.com/d-i/site-files/hands/type-files/default/base_exclude

and add a section like this to the syslinux.cfg on the stick:

   label auto
        kernel linux26
        append initrd=initrd26.gz ramdisk_size=10414 root=/dev/rd/0 rw preseed/file=/hd-media/preseed.cfg languagechooser/language-name=English countrychooser/shortlist=GB console-keymaps-at/keymap=uk  --

And maybe one like:

   label debug
        kernel linux26
        append initrd=initrd26.gz ramdisk_size=10414 root=/dev/rd/0 rw preseed/file=/hd-media/preseed.cfg languagechooser/language-name=English countrychooser/shortlist=GB console-keymaps-at/keymap=uk preseed/override=debug.cfg --


Unmount the stick and you're done.

(If you find that you're running out of room on the kernel command
 line for boot-time local/cfg= settings, you can make a tweaked
 netinst ISO image (conatining a tweaked initrd.gz image) as mentioned
 in the HOWTO-CD.txt, and use that for the language settings instead)

To install, boot from the stick, type auto at the boot prompt, go make
a cup of tea, and come back to a newly installed machine.

Take note -- the default install sets your root password to nothing,
so anyone who gets access to the console while you're away making your
tea owns the machine.  Various other configurations either install a
password, or install an ssh key, so don't just blindly use them unless
you don't mind me owning your machine :-)

You might also want to refer to http://hands.com/d-i/ for hints on
what you should type at the boot prompt.

Cheers, Phil.
