As recommended in

  http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.i386/ch04s02.html

grab a copy of the boot.img.gz:

  http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/sarge/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/boot.img.gz

put it on the stick (i.e. zcat boot.img.gz > /dev/sda)

Mount it (i.e. mount /dev/sda /mnt),

Read http://hands.com/d-i/HOWTO-CD.txt, and generate or grab an image.
and copy  the resulting imnage to /mnt (or wherever the stick is mounted).

Unmount the stick and you're done.

To install, boot from the stick, type a kernel command line with one or more
classes set in the -/- variable, or set the -/url variable, e.g.:

  boot:  linux -/-=uk;site-hands
or 
  boot:  linux26 -/-=kde341 -/url=http://intranet.example.com/d-i

go and make a cup of tea, and come back to a newly installed machine.

Take note -- the default install sets your root password to nothing,
so anyone who gets access to the console while you're away making your
tea owns the machine.  Various other configurations either install a
password, or install an ssh key, so don't just blindly use them unless
you don't mind me owning your machine :-)

You might also want to refer to http://hands.com/d-i/ for hints on
what you should type at the boot prompt.

Cheers, Phil.
