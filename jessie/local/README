The "local" directory is reserved for local site admin use.

The idea is that you can have both generic and class based preseed and
subclasses files, as well as things like local ssh authorized_keys files

I'd envisage a layout like this:

  local/preseed  -- preseed file comon across the site
  local/subclasses -- subclasses that should be on all site machines
  local/foo/*      -- preseed/subclass files that override the ones
                      from the main directory tree
  local/files/     -- a place to dump local, possibly security sensitive files

no files here should be submitted to the central svn.
