Note: the local.eg directory is not an active part of the install system

You will however find that a local directory is refered to by the
dashslashdash scripts.  The idea is that you can use this local.eg
directory as a template for what you might actually put in there.

Of course, the whole point of the local directory is that it stays
local to the site where it was created, becasue that the place to put
things that are either meningless elsewhere, or are security sensitive.

Examples of what the local directory might be used for should be put
here in local.eg (after paswwords, and the like have been replaced, of
course) to provide inspiration for others.

The rest of this README assumes that you've copied the local.eg directory
into place as local:

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This directory is reserved for local site admin use.

The idea is that you can have both generic and class based preseed and
subclasses files, as well as things like local ssh authorized_keys files

I'd envisage a layout like this:

  local/preseed  -- preseed file comon across the site
  local/subclasses -- subclasses that should be on all site machines
  local/foo/*      -- preseed/subclass files that override the ones
                      from the main directory tree
  local/files/     -- a place to dump local, possibly security sensitive files

no files here should be submitted to the central svn.

I intend to make dsd_fetch_file support some form of variable substitution
so that one might ask it to retrive a file:

   local/files/authorised_keys/%H

and it actually downloads the one names after the hostname, say.  It would be
good to be able to have it attempt to grab a file for each class a machine
was in, although dealing with the resulting files in a sane manner will
need some thought -- perhaps a similar expansion on the target, and some
tools based on the runnparts approach would do the trick.
