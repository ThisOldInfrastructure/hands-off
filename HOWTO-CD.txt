From standard Debian boot media:
================================

If using standard install images, then you can point at the preseed
scripts, either on your local copy, or the main site (for reasons of
paranoia, you should really copy the scripts to a local server,
convince yourself that they're not doing anything naughty, and then
point at your local server, but if you cannot be bothered, feel free
to just point at the main site.

So, at the boot prompt type something like:

boot:  linux preseed/url=http://hands.com/d-i/dashslashdash.cfg

PROBLEMS:

  The trouble with doing this is that the preseed files are only
  grabbed after the network is up, so you will still get asked for the
  machine name.

  Also, we'll get the language prompts, and prompts such as selecting
  the network interface to use if multiple NICs are present.

Using a customised image:
=========================

1) Building your own:

loop mount the image you want to base your custom one on:

  mount -o loop,ro debian-31r0a-i386-netinst.iso /mnt

create a working directory, and copy the contents there, and make the
copy writable:

  
  mkdir d-i-CD
  cp -a /mnt d-i-CD/new
  chmod -R +w d-i-CD/new

and unmount the cd image:

  umount /mnt

Next we need to produce tweaked versions of the initrd files, with the
dashslashdash.udeb added (Note, it is possible to achieve the
same effect by specifying a few parameters on the command line, but
this consumes to many kernel parameters, and so removes the
flexibility of being able to specify the -/-= parameter with any
certainty).

Tweaking initrd
===============

Decompress the initrd.gz of interest:

  zcat d-i-CD/new/install/2.6/initrd.gz > /tmp/initrd-2.6

and/or

  zcat d-i-CD/new/install/initrd.gz > /tmp/initrd-2.4

*********************************************************
*** Then follow the instructions in README-initrd.txt ***
*********************************************************

Now you just compress the initrd you just unmounted:

  gzip < /tmp/initrd-2.6 > d-i-CD/new/install/2.6/initrd.gz
or
  gzip < /tmp/initrd-2.4 > d-i-CD/new/install/initrd.gz

(repeat for the other initrd if you want support for both 2.4 & 2.6 kernels)

--


To save typing, you can add targets to new/isolinux/isolinux.cfg:

=-=-=-=-
LABEL kde341
  kernel /install/vmlinuz
  append vga=normal initrd=/install/initrd.gz ramdisk_size=10240 root=/dev/rd/0 devfs=mount,dall rw -/-=kde341;site-mysite --
=-=-=-=-

Also edit d-i-CD/new/isolinux/isolinux.txt, adding something above the boot
prompt so it's clear that you've tweaked the image. I use this, please
come up with your own:

=-=-=-=-
splash.rle

Phil Hands' preseed tweaked netinst --- see http://hands.com/d-i/ for details
add -/-=<class>;... and/or -/url=http://... parameter for an automatic install

Press F1-control ...
=-=-=-=-

Note, that that file contains control characters, and ends without a
newline, so you'll need to edit it with something that will leave that
intact (I use emacs).

Now make the new iso image:

  mkisofs -o d-i-CD/new.iso -r -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table d-i-CD/new
  
and burn it with something like this:

  cdrecord -v speed=16 dev=/dev/cdroms/cdrom0 -eject driveropts=burnproof d-i-CD/new.iso

If you're feeling incredibly lazy (and trusting), here's one I made earlier:

  http://hands.com/d-i/misc/debian-31r0a-i386-netinst-hands-preseed.iso

Once you've got a CD, boot from it, and read http://hands.com/d-i/ for
hints on what to type at the boot prompt to kick things off.

Have Fun!


TODO:

  Make a CD with all the preseed files, all the associated scripts,
  and all the packages that get downloaded, so that you can preseed a
  machine with no NIC -- if anyone does this, please tell me about it.

Cheers, Phil.
